This is the design document (sorry):
===================FILE FORMAT=======================================================
-(.bmf) is used for static mesh file
-(.bsmf) is used for skeletal mesh animated file
-(.skel) is used for the skeleton
-(.skam) is used for each animation -> linked to the base skeleton
-(.drawref) is used to describe renderables (instanced per unit though, so some unit can be modifiable)



==================TODO==============================================================
-[BMF EXPORTER] : add option to save each mesh separated by material
-[SKEL EXPORTER] : only needs {name, parentName, headLocal, tailLocal, rotLocal}
